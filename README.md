# MojoSetup

MojoSetup is a standalone installer for Linux, designed to help third-party
developers that need to ship software outside of traditional package
management infrastructure.

The long, technical explanation of features and design can be read
[in the original announcement email](https://icculus.org/pipermail/lokisetup/2007-May/000810.html).

**We always need help with localization!** You can contribute a sentence or
two of translation from English to your native language, we are extremely
grateful. You can do this [at launchpad.net](https://translations.launchpad.net/mojosetup/).

Please read docs.txt for all the gritty details about building an installer.
